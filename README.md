# About
Blitzpid was created in September 2020, initially using PocketMine software but later transitioning to a dedicated server to support modding. The server experienced a temporary shutdown in November 2020 due to data corruption but was restored in December 2020 and continued running until April 2021, when the owner decided to close it. @than-sanchez operated a Minecraft Java server with crossplay from July 2021 to September 2021. In January 2022, the owner attempted to revive Blitzpid Bedrock, but it did not last long due to a lack of players.
